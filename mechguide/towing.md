# Mechanic Guide - Towing
As a mechanic you can tow Illegally parked cars with a tow truck. Tow Trucks spawn at mod shops, get in one to begin towing.
Illegally parked cars are marked with a yellow cone, ride up to to them and use the towing button to get it loaded up.

Once you get the vehicle onto the tow truck, a timer will start. If you do not get the car to the police impound in time, the owner will be able to call it back.
When you get to the impound, drop the car off for a bit of cash.

*You can tow legally parked cars too but you cannot get them to a police impound. Players can kill you if you are impounding their vehicle.*
