# Mechanic Guide - Managing Pricing

As a mechanic you can set custom prices in the Job Menu -> Services and offer them from 50% market value up to 250% market value.
Setting less than 100% is usually reccomended, as more players are drawn to your offer, opposed to setting it high and having but a handful of customers.
