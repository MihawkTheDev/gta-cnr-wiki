# Mechanics
When you inevitably smash your vehicle into pieces, you might want to fix it. That's why there are many mechanics around the map, marked with a green wrench and screwdriver icon.

## Services

## Planes and Helis
Aircraft have dedicated repair locations, marked by the same icon but a different color. Plane repair locations are purple, while helicopter repair locations are orange.

## Calling a Mechanic
If there are many mechanic players online, you can try to call one in your Phone menu. Press M and navigate to *Phone > Services > Mechanic*. 

Mechanic players can instantly repair your vehicle.

## Repair Kits
Another option you have to repair your vehicles pretty quickly is to use *Engine Repair Kits* and *Tire Repair Kits*. You cannot buy these items directly from a shop, unless you are a mechanic; to obtain them you need to buy them from a mechanic player.
