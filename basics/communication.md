# Communication
Communication is essential to the gameplay; whether you prefer text or voice chat, we got you covered.

## Text Chat
Press **T** to show the chatbox.

### Global
To send a message to the whole server, just type it and press enter.

### Commands
If your text starts with a slash (`/`), it will be ran as a command. Please, refer to the [commands](/wiki/basics/commands) page for details.

### DMs
To send a direct message to someone, you can prefix your message with the `/dm` command. A ping sound will be played on the computer of the other player. Sometimes you may be unable to send a DM because players may have disabled their DMs with the `/dms` command, or they may have blocked you.

### Colors, Emojis and GIFs
You can pick colors, emojis and even send GIFs from Tenor from within the chatbox. Some of these options may be available only to Premium Members.

### Mentioning
You can mention other players by typing `@` followed by their id. For example, `Hello @2, what's up`, will become `Hello @Sasino (2), what's up`, and it will play a ping sound on the computer of the mentioned player, unless they have blocked you.

### Scrolling
You can scroll up and down using **PgUp** and **PgDn** while the chatbox is open.

### HUD Layout
You can change the position of the chatbox in *M > Options > Display > HUD Layout*. In the standard layout, the chatbox is at the top-left as in SA-MP, while in the inverted layout, the chat will move to the middle-right of the screen, as in GTA Online.

## Voice Chat
By default, it's disabled. You can change this by pressing Esc and navigating to Settings > Voice chat.

### Indicator
If someone has voice chat disabled and can't hear anyone, you will see an indicator over their gamertag, showing a striked headset.

### Push-to-Talk
If you choose to use push-to-talk, the default key is **N**. You can change this hotkey under Esc > Settings > Keybinds > Voice chat. This is the best option for privacy.

### Voice-Activated
If you choose the voice-activated mode, everything you say in your mic will be heard in-game directly. This option is recommended if you have an easily accessible mute switch on your headset, or a hotkey.

### Proximity
The default voice chat mode is proximity, meaning that only nearby players can hear you. The closer you are to a player, the louder their voice.

## Radio
When you are on certain jobs or in a party, you are equipped with a radio that allows you to talk with distant players. 

To view your radio menu, type `/radio`. In this menu, you are able to turn your radio on and off, change the volume, and change the channel.

## Voice
To talk on the radio, hold the radio key. By default it's **Alt**, but you can change it in *Esc > Options > Keybinds > FiveM*. There is no voice-activated mode for the radio.

## Text
You can also type on a radio channel. To do this, simply open your chatbox and prefix your message with an exclamation mark `!`.
