There are many ways to make money in the server, you can choose the one you prefer and stick to it, or you can explore the various jobs and activities.

## Accounts
There are two main accounts that all players have:
- Cash
- Bank

When the server refers to "checks" and "cards", it means the bank account, while when it refers to your "wallet", it means your cash.

Some types of business only take cash, while other only take card payments (bank).

You should not carry too much cash, as other players could [pickpocket](/wiki/crimguide/pickpocketing) you.

## Checking your Balance
Tap Z or d-pad down to display your balance, which will appear on the top right hand side of the screen. 

The dark green one (top) is your cash; the light green one (bottom) is your bank account balance.

## Withdrawing and Depositing Cash
You can access your bank account by visiting any bank or ATM on the map. 

ATMs are easier to find, but they have a fee. Banks, on the other hand, have no fees, and they also allow you to access your history of transactions, and to transfer money to other players.

## Bills and Debt
If you have money in your bank account, hospital bills and bail bonds will be billed to it.

If you don't have enough money, you will go into debt. Every in-game day
