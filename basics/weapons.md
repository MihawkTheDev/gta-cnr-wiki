# Weapons
Weapons are the pinnacle of America, so they have a special place on our server.

## How to Obtain
To get them, visit a Gun Store, Convenience Store, Illegal Gun Store or a Police Armory and buy them for your current loadout.

## Loadouts
Currently, there are 3 loadouts:
- Police Officer
- Paramedic
- Other

All jobs use the "Other" loadout, while police officers and paramedics have separate loadouts, because some weapons may be exclusively available on one of these jobs, while other weapons may be restricted on a certain job.

## Confiscation
Some weapons and ammo types are illegal and if you are caught and searched with them on you, they may be confiscated and you will have to rebuy them; however, any attachment purchased is permanent and it will be re-attached upon the next purchase.
