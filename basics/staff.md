# Server Staff
Sometimes you will come across staff members, either in a uniform or in their vehicles. If they are on moderation duty, they will appear as a green blip on your radar. Though more often than not, they are invisible and watching players.

If you see their signature red and blue CnR hoodie, a gray STAFF jumper or green buffalo cars marked with their rank driving around, these are staff members. Testers, video editors and other non-moderator staff members can use staff uniforms and hoodies too.

If you need help with something, feel free to approach them and ask questions.
