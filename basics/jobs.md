# Jobs

## Switching
You can switch jobs by going to the specific job's location and interacting with the NPC. The menu will contain an option to switch to that job, or, if you are already on that job, an option to switch back to civilian (unemployed).

## Checking a Player's Job
To check someone's job, the straightforward way is to hold Z to open the scoreboard and find them in there.

However, there's a less known way which is actually faster and doesnt't require you to browse the scoreboard: the `/i` command; simply type `/i [player id]` and a menu with their job, XP, level and other basic information will show up.
