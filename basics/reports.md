# Reporting Players
Note: When reporting a player, the burden of proof is on you and the reported player is innocent until proven guilty.

## Reporting in Game
You can report a player in-game via the Help menu. Press M or Select, scroll to the bottom, and select *Help > Report player*.

Alternatively, you can also type the `/report [id]` command to start a report.

**Note:** Please keep the details field as short as possible, only including the important details.

## Reporting on Discord
If you have concrete evidence of a rule breaker, you can start a report in the Reports section as long as you are a verified player and not blacklisted. Don't forget to attach a clip!
