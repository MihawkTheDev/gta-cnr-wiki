## Contracting Diseases
### Airborne
Airborne diseases will randomly spawn on a random player, whenever the server feels like it, according to their rarity, but the most common way to get them is from other sick players.

### Foodborne
Foodborne diseases are contained within foods that your character can eat. Some types of food are much more riskier than others: for example, try to eat a lot of chicken wings!

<!-- 
### Waterborne
Waterborne pathogens are lurking in unsafe stagnant water. If you stay too long in such waters there's a risk of contracting one of these diseases.

## Symptoms
Each disease can have one or more symptoms. However, all diseases deplete your health gradually; some diseases are deadly, while others will leave you with 1 HP.

### Fever
The most common symptom. When you have fever, you will start walking slowly, and you will be vulnerable to falls. It usually lasts a few seconds, and it has no effects on other players.

### Cough
When you cough, you will instantly spread your pathogens to nearby players. Depending on the *spread* (or transmissibility) of the disease, as well as randomness, nearby players may or may not get sick.

To significantly reduce the chances of getting sick from coughing players, you can wear any type of *mask*. Also, when you are sick, you can avoid infecting other players by wearing a mask yourself.

### Vomit
Vomit is probably the riskiest of these symptoms. When you vomit, the area is contaminated for quite a while. If any player walks near your vomit, they are likely to get sick, and there's nothing they can wear to prevent it.

## Getting Better
Usually you want to cure your illness, unless you are a maniac who wants to infect everyone (and there are no rules against this behavior).

### Waiting it out
Some diseases will end on their own, you just have to wait them out. In the meantime, the effects will still continue to affect you and nearby players, so be aware of this.

### Hospital Treatment
A better option to get rid of your illness is to just drive to a hospital to get cured, especially when there are no medical doctors online.

### Calling a Medical Doctor
Medical Doctors can cure and heal you, as well as sell you medkits, bandages and other medical items that you may need.
