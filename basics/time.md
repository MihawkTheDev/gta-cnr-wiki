## Real-Life Units
One game hour corresponds to one in-real life minute.

## Days of the Week
The days of a game week are the same as a real week, and they are set to start on Sunday.

The time is displayed in the 24-hour format. You can check what is the current day of the week and time by pressing Z or dpad down.
