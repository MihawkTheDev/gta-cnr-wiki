# Parties
**No, not this type of party: ðŸ’ƒðŸ•ºðŸŽ‰**! Parties allow you to play with a group of friends more easily by enabling certain features:

- Dedicated [radio channel](/wiki/basics/communication#radio)
- See other party members' blips on your radar from any distance
- Green circle around their blip, for easy identification
- Disabled some crime reports (assault, carjacking, and similar)
- Disabled revenge system
