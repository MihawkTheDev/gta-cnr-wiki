# XP and Levels
You earn experience (XP) by completing tasks related to your role.

For example: As a criminal, you rob stores, rob npcs, export cars, scrap cars and collect bounties.

You gain a level once your experience bar fills all the way up.

Once a level is gained, the bar will reset, and it will display how much XP you need to gain the next level.

Tap **Z** or d-pad down to view your XP bar. It will be located at the top center of your screen.
