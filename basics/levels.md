## Leveling up
You gain a level once your XP bar fills all the way up. Once a level is gained, the bar will reset, and it will display how much XP you need to gain the next level.

Currently, you stop leveling up when you reach 1 million XP, but this will likely change in the future.

## Level-locked content
With each level you unlock some content, which can include:
- Jobs
- Clothes
- Vehicles
- Weapons
- Weapon Attachments
- Weapon Skins
- Real Estate
- Sellers

The majority of the content will be unlocked by level 30.
