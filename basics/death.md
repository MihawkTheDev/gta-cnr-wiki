# Death
When you inevitably die, your character will fall to the ground and, if available, you will be given an option to **respawn** or **call 911**.

If no paramedic or medical doctor is available in your area, you will automatically respawn.

## Respawn
If you choose to respawn, you will be immediately teleported to a hospital where you will be billed for medical services and bail if you had a wanted level upon death. 

## Calling 911
Calling 911 alerts paramedics and medical doctors in your area of your emergency, and it makes your character stay on the ground until a paramedic or medical doctor revives you, or the timer runs out and you die.

## Forced Wait
If you die when paramedics are nearby, you will be forced to wait and won't have the option to respawn.

If the nearby paramedics die or leave the area however, you will be able to respawn.

## Medical Bill
Upon respawn or revive, you will be automatically billed. Being revived is significantly cheaper than respawning at the hospital.

If you are unable to pay the bill, you will go into [debt](/wiki/basics/money#bills-and-debt).

**Note:** Some deaths don't allow for being revived, they will instead immediately respawn you. 
Additionally, you cannot bribe police officers for 2 minutes after being revived with a wanted level, so be wary if you are entering combat with illegal contraband on you.
