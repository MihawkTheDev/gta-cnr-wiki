# Redzones
A redzone, or PvP zone, is an area where civilians or criminals can open fire on anyone who enters for any reason. 

They are marked on the radar and the main map as a red circle, and in the world as a 3D cylinder.

## Static Redzones
Static redzones are redzones that are always active, and never disappear from the map. 

On [hardcore servers](/wiki/hardcore) there are way more static redzones than on standard servers.

## Bonus Redzones
A bonus redzone is a redzone that gives advantages for taking certain actions while inside it.

- Criminals receive a payout for killing cops and paramedics
- Cops receive a 50% bonus for killing and arresting criminals
- Paramedics receive a 50% bonus for healing and reviving anyone

There can only be one active bonus redzone at a time.
