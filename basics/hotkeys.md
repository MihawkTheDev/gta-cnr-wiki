# Hotkeys
Hotkeys are a way to access an item or a command with the touch of a button, rather than selecting it from a menu or typing it. 
You can use it for anything from messing around to tactical advantages.

## Setting up
Press **M** to open the main menu. Scroll down to *Options*, then select *Hotkeys*.

## Hotkey types
Hotkeys can be set for the following actions:
1. Weapon
2. Item
3. Command

## Activating
Once a hotkey is set, it can be triggered by pressing the corresponding key; by default these keys are set to 1 to 0 on your keyboard.

Keys can be customized in the pause menu by pressing Esc and navigating to *Settings > Key Bindings > FiveM*.
