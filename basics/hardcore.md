# Hardcore Servers
Some of the Cops and Robbers V servers are marked as "Hardcore". Let's find out what this means.

## Reduced Player Visibility
On hardcore servers, you can't see the blip of other players on your radar, and you can only see their gamer tag when you are directly looking at them, and only from a certain distance.

This creates more tension and surprise for players, enables skilled players to successfully evade the cops, and it requires cops to do more teamwork. 

In general, it requires everyone to play smarter and harder, and that's why this is the main difference of hardcore mode.

## More Redzones
Hardcore servers have **more** static redzones. This means that there's an increased risk of having to cross one while other players may be camping it.

## Reduced Health
Players have 25% less health an armor, reducing the duration of fights and the time to kill. This results in a higher skill cap, and it requires players to be more mindful of their actions, whereas on the standard servers it's acceptable to jump directly into any fight without cover.

## Longer Healing Cooldowns
Medkits and armor have an increased cooldown, making healing less practical than taking proper cover and killing the enemy first.

## XP Bonus
Hardcore servers have a 10% XP bonus on everything. A nice perk for playing on a riskier server.

## List
Currently, the hardcore servers are:
- NA2
- EU2
