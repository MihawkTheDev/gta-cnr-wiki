# EMS Guide - Responding to Calls

There are two types of calls:

1. A player severely wounded and needs to be revived. When a player reaches 0 health, this call is automatically made by the server.

2. A player is wounded, needs to be healed. This call is made by the player via Services menu.

An alert will popup in the top left corner of the screen alerting you that a player is in trouble. Press 'Y' or hold d-pad up to accept the duty. 
Upon accepting, you will automatically log their location into your GPS. Follow the yellow line to find the player.
To get XP for reponding to a call, follow the GPS until it ends in a circle. Upon entering that circle (destination) you will be awarded XP.
