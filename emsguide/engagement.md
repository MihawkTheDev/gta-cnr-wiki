# EMS Guide - Rules of Engagement
You're a paramedic. So firing your weapon is the last thing you want to be doing. You are not law enforcement and you are not a criminal. 
Your job is not to chase down criminals, assist cops in arrests or shoot other players. 
With the exception being: You can shoot at other players in self-defense but are they to flee, you cannot pursue them.
