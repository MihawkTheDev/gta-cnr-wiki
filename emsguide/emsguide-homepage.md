# EMS Guide
Ah, paramedics. Quite a simple job, so this guide won't be long. Read the whole thing and remember that you can't help cops with stopping crims!
To heal players you can now use your Personal Ambulance which can be bought at certain hospitals.
As a paramedic, you have a duty to retreat. You aren't a cop nor a criminal and you can only shoot in self defense. In the job, you revive critically wounded players marked by a gray flashing dot. 
To become a medic, go to a hospital and interact with the NPC.
