# Cops and Robbers V Wiki
## Format
The wiki is written in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format, with some HTML support.
You probably already know some Markdown, because many popular apps, including Discord, support writing in Markdown, for example, you can add `#` at the start of the sentence to mark it as a heading, and wrap words in `**` to make them bold.

## Index file
There's an `index.md` file which is used by the CNRV website to automatically generate the navigation tree view. It's basically a simple bullet list with multiple levels of depth. It can be as deep as you want, but we recommend a maximum of 4 levels to keep the navigation tree easily readable.

## Paths
The full path of the file determines the URL of the page. For example the file at /startguide/colors.md will be viewable at https://gtacnr.net/wiki/startguide/colors.

Page and folder names must be **lowercase**, only contain **alphanumeric** characters (a-z, 0-9) and dashes (no spaces or symbols). The best practice is to separate each word with a dash `-`.
