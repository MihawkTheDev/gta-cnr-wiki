# Assets - Warehouses

Warehouses act like a storage facility. Here, you can drop off or pick up items you have stored at the specific warehouse you purchased.

If you take a look into your inventory (Press 'M' or left middle button and select 'Inventory'), you will notice that all items have a weight to them. For example: This Medkit weighs 250G. Some items are weighed in KG, others in Grams (G). 1000G = 1KG

Keep weight in mind, because each storage facility does have a max weight limit, you cannot put an infinite amount of items inside.

| Warehouse Size | Max Capacity        |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Small          | 100 KG or 100,000 G |
| Medium         | 250 KG or 250,000 G |
| Large          | 500 KG or 500,000 G |
