# Assets - How to Get a Vehicle?
There are a couple different vehicle types, each one is saved differently.
#### Stolen Vehicle

To save a stolen car, drive it to your garage and put it inside. Stolen cars don't have insurance so they will be gone after destruction. 

#### Personal Vehicle

To get a personal vehicle, you need to go to one of the vehicle dealerships, find the vehicle you want and buy it.

Personal Vehicles can be bought in 3 places as of writing, Simeon's Car Dealership, the Used Car Dealer in Mosley's and a Truck Dealer in the Grand Senora Desert. After buying a car and choosing a garage for it, you can take it on a joyride and call it in anytime from the interaction menu. 

#### Job Vehicle

To get a job vehicle, visit a Police Station as a cop and choose the car you want to buy. Every police station type [LSPD, LSSD, BCSO, SAHP] has different vehicles. You don't need a garage for Job Vehicles. 
Analogically, paramedics can buy ambulances and other Job Vehicles at certain Hospitals!

#### Membership Vehicles

Some vehicles are locked and can only be purchased if you have a Silver or Gold Membership. They are usually cheaper and faster than the base cars.

If you have a membership you can also apply Vanity Plates on your vehicles as long as someone else doesn't have the same Plate on your current server.
