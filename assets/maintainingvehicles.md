# Assets - Maintaining Vehicles
After you purchase a vehicle, you can perform dozens of different actions and stunts with it.
You have to keep in mind that using up all your fuel or disabling your vehicle can force you to use the Maintenance option in the vehicle menu to refuel and repair it.


#### Repair Kits

If your tire breaks, you can use a Tire Repair Kit from your inventory to get moving again!

If your engine goes down, in many vehicles you have the option to use the Engine Repair Kit from your inventory to restart it and be able to drive again.

There are repair kits for Airplanes, Helicopters and Boats too but they require a mechanic with specific paperwork to use them.


#### Tuning

If your vehicle supports mods, you can tune it up in any Mod Shop as long as there is a supplied Mechanic player in there. Some vehicles only support performance mods and others have full on customization options for your vehicle.


#### Maintenance Option

In the interaction menu, you can find a dedicated Maintenance option which fixes up and refuels your vehicle for a few thousand dollars. Be aware that sending your vehicle to Maintenance puts it on cooldown and you can't use it for a few minutes.
