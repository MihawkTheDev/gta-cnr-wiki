# Starter Guide - Death
When you inevitably die, your character will fall to the ground and you will be given an option to respawn or wait for a paramedic, if you choose to respawn, you will immediately teleport to a hospital where you will be billed for medical services and bail if you had a wanted level upon death. Waiting alerts all paramedics to your need of help and makes your character stay on the ground until a paramedic arrives or the on-screen timer elapses. If you die when paramedics are nearby, you will be forced to wait and won't have the option to respawn, if the nearby medics die or leave the area however, you will be able to respawn. If the medical bill is higher than the amout of money you have, you will go in debt causing you to be unable to call cars or buy items until you pay it back. Your debt along with interest will automatically be paid at noon in game time.


**Note:** Some deaths don't allow for being revived, they will instead immediately respawn you. 
Additionally, you cannot bribe police officers for 2 minutes after being revived with a wanted level, so be wary if you are entering combat with illegal contraband on you.
