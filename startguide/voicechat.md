# Starter Guide - Voice Chat
While not required, it is recommended that you enable voice chat. Alternatively, you can use the textchat if you are not comfortable using voice chat.

Voice chat works on a AOE (Area of effect) basis. This means that it is based on range. The closer you are to a player, the more likely you are to hear them, and vice-versa.

By default, voice chat should be set as **N** to talk. You can change this by pressing ESC > Settings > Voice Chat. We recommend not using push to talk as it can be difficult to try and press a button while you're in the middle of action! Voice activated is most recommended.
