# Starter Guide - Player IDs
This number is displayed after a player's username, both above a character's head and also in the in-game chatbot. For example: Golfistayt (7) - in this case, Golfistayt's ID is 7. 
ID numbers are automatically assigned by the server upon logging in. Your ID will be different each time you login to the server. Players can use these numbers to message each other, report other players and etc.
