# Starter Guide - Player List and IDs
Hold the 'Z' or d-pad down key. While holding Z, you can use the 'PG UP' and 'PG DOWN' or use your middle mouse scroll button to venture through the list of players.
The list will show the player's ID, Username, Job, Total XP, Their level (listed as level) and ping (latency), in miliseconds.

The ID is displayed after a player's username, both above a character's head and also in the in-game chatbot. For example: Golfistayt (7) - in this case, Golfistayt's ID is 7. 
ID numbers are automatically assigned by the server upon logging in. Your ID will be different each time you login to the server. Players can use these numbers to message each other, report other players and etc.
