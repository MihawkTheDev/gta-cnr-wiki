# Starter Guide - Redzones
A red zone is an area where criminals can open fire on anyone who enters for any reason. Players can pass by or stick around in these areas as long as they want. They can shoot other criminals, law enforcement, paramedics, drug dealers and mechanics! Enter at own risk. Anyone can be killed.  The most common place where red zones come in play are export locations.
**EMS and Cops cannot fire on sight in redzones**
