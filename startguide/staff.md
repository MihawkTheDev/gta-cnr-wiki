# Starter Guide - Server Staff

Sometimes you will come across active staff members, either in a uniform or in their vehicles. If visible, they will appear as a green dot on your map. Though more often than not, they are invisible and watching players.

If you see their signature red and blue CnR hoodie, a gray STAFF jumper or green buffalo cars marked with their rank driving around, these are staff members. Please do NOT attempt to get into a staff vehicle. If they have a green blip, they have god mode, so good luck killing them. If you need help with something, feel free to approach them and ask questions if you have any. Be aware that testers, video editors and other non-moderator staff can use the uniform too, however they cannot use a staff car.
