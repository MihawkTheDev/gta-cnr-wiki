# Starter Guide - Checking Your Balance
Tap 'Z' or d-pad down to display your balance, which will appear on the top right hand side of the screen. You will notice two different currencies.

The dark green (top) is your wallet. The light green (bottom) is your bank account. You can access your bank account by visiting any ATM machine on the map.

If you have money in your account, hospital bills and bail will be billed through your account, not your wallet. Try to keep a positive balance in your account if possible to avoid incurring debt.

You can also check your balance by typing in "**how much money**" in the chat
