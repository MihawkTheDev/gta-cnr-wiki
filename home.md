# Cops and Robbers V Wiki

Cops and Robbers V (formerly known as GTA Cops and Robbers, GTA CnR, or simply CnR) is a [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v) multiplayer server operated and developed by [Sasinosoft Games](https://sasinosoft.com/). It is based on the [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform. CnR V is not an RP server, as roleplaying is not part of the gameplay and isn't required, but you can play as a police officer, a criminal or a variety of other jobs.

## Gameplay
Cops and Robbers V offers a wide array of jobs to play as and activities to partake in, additionally the server staff often host exhilarating in-game events which pit you against other players in a fight for the reward. Combat zones and hardcore servers await for those that are brave enough to enter them, and tens of custom vehicles are at your disposal.
