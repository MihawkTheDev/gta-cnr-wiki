# Cops and Robbers V Wiki

Cops and Robbers V (formerly known as GTA Cops and Robbers, GTA CnR, or simply CnR) is a [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v) multiplayer server operated and developed by [Sasinosoft Games](https://sasinosoft.com/). It is based on the [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) platform. CnR V is not an RP server, as roleplaying is not part of the gameplay and isn't required, but you can play as a police officer, a criminal or a variety of other jobs.
