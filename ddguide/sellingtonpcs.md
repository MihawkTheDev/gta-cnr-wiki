# Drug Dealer Guide - Selling to NPCs
WARNING! Some NPCs are undercover cops, and you can gain a wanted level for attempting to sell to them, additionally the drug spot will be locked for you for 45 minutes.

Drug Spots

Drug spots allow you to sell drugs to NPCs. They are seen as a little red dollar symbol icon on your map. Tip: You will find it easier to use drug spots that are at a distance from other online players, as nearby weapons being fired or dead bodies in the area scare away NPCs.

Some drug spots are superior for different types of drugs. There is no specific 'best spot', but some spots such as Drug Spot 9 are better for cocaine, while others, like Grove St. are good for heroin.

Approaching the circle and standing inside will start drug dealing. Leaving the circle will end the event.
Simply wait inside the circle until an NPC approaches you. You will then have the option to sell to them by pressing 'Y' or holding d-pad up.
