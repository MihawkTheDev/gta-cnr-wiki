# Drug Dealer Guide - Selling to Players
Players must approach you in order to sell drugs to them. So first, you must set up a meeting. This can be done by either them reaching out or you advertising. Just watch out for cops!

Press 'Y' or hold d-pad up to offer a nearby player drugs

**Players reaching out**

Players can Press 'M' or left middle button go into "Services" and select "Drugs" to call for a drug dealer. It will display a message at the top left corner of your screen saying who is looking for drugs and where they are located. They will be waiting for you to meet them at that location. There may be other competition out there! Get to the buyer before another drug dealer does.


**Making the sale**

Once a player is within range, you can press 'Y' or hold d-pad up to offer them drugs. The rest is under their control. It will display a popup menu on their screen where they can browse your drugs and purchase whatever they want. You don't have to do anything extra!
