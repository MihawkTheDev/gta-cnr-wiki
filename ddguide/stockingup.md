# Drug Dealer Guide - Stocking Up
You stock up from suppliers and sell to NPCs or players. Here are the NPCs you purchase drug stock from, and where to find them. They will appear as a red pill icon on your map.

Note: Buying in bulk is cheaper. This is why you will see a price range instead of a set price under cost. Smaller amounts cost more per gram, larger amounts cost less per gram. The highest price per gram you see is the minimum quantity: 20g and the lowest price per gram you see is the maximum quantity: 1,000g.
