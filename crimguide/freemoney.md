# Criminal Guide - Unemployment Check

Remember who caught Capone? The IRS. Fortunately they don't know about your dirty cash yet and won't break down your door just today. 
At 12:00PM (Noon) each in-game day, you will recieve an unemployment check for the sum of $10,000, which will be sent to your bank account. 
Remember that if you have more than 500K in your bank account you won't receive this.
