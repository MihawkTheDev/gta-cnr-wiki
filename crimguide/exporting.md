# Criminal Guide - Exporting
**Exporting cars will give you a wanted level.**
Upon entering some vehicles, you may see a message at the top left hand corner of the screen saying that you can export the vehicle, and it will list the amount. Press Y or d-pad up to enable GPS to navigate to the export dock. If it does not give you this message upon entering the vehicle, it means that this vehicle is not eligible for export.
The most wanted export vehicle spawns everyday at 5AM and if it isn't exported till next day, the value increases.
Upon arriving at the export dock, you will find a red circle. Drive your vehicle onto the red circle and press 'Y' or d-pad up to export.
