# Criminal Guide
Welcome to the Criminal Guide Homepage, check all the articles out to learn how to effectively play as a criminal! Remember to follow the [rules](https://gtacnr.net/rules)
If you haven't read the Starter Guide yet, I strongly encourage you do. It will allow you to understand the basics more before diving into the do's and don'ts of the criminal life.

When you start off on the server you automatically get the Criminal [None] Job. If you switch to another job, just come back to the NPC that recruits for that job and switch to a Civilian. 
You can do lots of things as a criminal including exporting vehicles, robbing stores, bounty hunting and more!
