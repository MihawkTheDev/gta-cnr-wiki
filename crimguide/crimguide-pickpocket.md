# Criminal Guide - Pickpocketing
Pickpocketing NPCs or players is a quick way to make some cash when in a tight spot. 

In order to rob an NPC, they need to be in neutral stance. This means they are sitting idle, standing idle, or walking about, and not engaging you, another player or npc in any way (such as fighting or running away).

Walk up close to an NPC or player and press **B** or **RS**  to rob them.

You can also pickpocket players but items such as fake wallets have a chance to stop your attempt, if you succeed you will get a portion of the money the player had in their wallet but to claim the money you need to leave the area before you die.
If you are killed the money goes back to its' rightful owner.
