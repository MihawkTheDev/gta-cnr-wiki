- <Emoji>🔫</Emoji> <Color id="5">Shootouts</Color>: often under the influence of drugs, some **criminals don't hesitate to shoot on sight...** It's a very dangerous situation that requires teamplay from the police force.

### Responding to emergency calls
Everytime a crime is committed, **you'll receive an alert giving you some information** like: 

- <Emoji>🧾</Emoji> The **type of crime/felony** (<Color id="non_violent">non-violent</Color> or <Color id="violent">violent</Color>)

<Img src="/cops/responding_to_calls.webp" alt="An Officer inside an unmarked Buffalo SX is observing a player selling drugs" />

<Aside type="tip">
    You can do <Color id="gps">/cleargps</Color> if you want to remove the <Color id="gps">GPS point</Color>.
</Aside>

### Dispatch Calls

Sometimes when big crimes gathering criminals happens *(such as the **Jewelry** <Blip type="jewelry" /> being robbed)*, all police officers will get a special purple "Dispatch" call on their notification feed above the mini-map.

The area in which this dispatch got called will start blinking in <Color id="police">blue</Color> on the map, and going there to arrest / take down suspects will award bonus money!

<Img src="/cops/jewerly_dispatch.webp" alt="Cops: Jewerly dispatch" />

### Catching drug dealers
Some players can play as <Color id="2" href="./../civilian/drug-dealer">Drug Dealer</Color>: they are **selling drugs to NPC's to gain money and XP**, but as you know drugs are bad and as a <Color id="police">Police Officer</Color>, **your duty is to fight against that**.

**To catch a drug dealer**:
<Steps>
    1. Stay hidden not far from the suspect
    2. Wait for them to **make the deal with the NPC**<br />
    *(You'll see them play a trade animation once the NPC come close)*
    3. If you are close enough, they will receive the <Color id="2">Drug Trafficking</Color> felony and you'll be able to [arrest them](#arresting-a-suspect).<br />
    *(You can ram at low speed with your vehicle or taze them if you are on foot)*
</Steps>

Sometimes, some drugs dealers are **already wanted on their spot**: you can simply arrest them just like any other criminal, without waiting for them to sell.

<Aside type="tip">
    Using an **unmarked vehicle** will help you: civilians won't see your marker/name as <Color id="police">blue</Color> until you get **close enough** or **turn on** your siren.
</Aside>

    An Officer inside an **unmarked Buffalo SX** is observing a player selling drugs
</Img>

<Aside type="tip">
    Although less popular, some players are also selling weapons & illegal equipement as **[Arms dealers](./../civilian/arms-dealer)** : catching them selling to other players will also give them a similar felony, which allows you to arrest & seize them !
</Aside>

## Encounter with criminals

There are lots of different criminals you can encounter while playing, ranging from petty dismeanors to major felonies on the NPCs & Players: identifying them and taking the good course of action is one of the most important qualification to be a good cop.

### Ticketing a suspect
When you see **a suspect with** <Color id="1">one star</Color>, you can't arrest them, but instead you can **ask them to pull over** and **give them a ticket.** 

You can get between <Color id="money">$750</Color> to <Color id="money">$25,000</Color> by ticketing them.

<Aside>If the suspect **doesn't pull over and leaves the area**, or **refuses the ticket**, he will get a wanted level for <Color id="2">Evading an officer</Color>/<Color id="2">Refusing a ticket</Color>, allowing you to [**arrest them**](#arresting-a-suspect)</Aside> 

<Img src="/cops/ticket.webp" alt="Police Officer: Officer gives ticket to 1 star suspect" style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px;" />

### Arresting a suspect
The first duty of a <Color id="police">Police Officer</Color> is to **arrest criminals**. To arrest a suspect you need to be near the criminal and press <Keyboard>X</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="UP" /> to handcuff them.
- <Color id="2">2★</Color>: You can get <Color id="money">$15,000</Color> by arresting them (**bonus**: <Color id="money">$6,750</Color> | **assisting the arrest**: <Color id="money">$3,000</Color>)
- <Color id="3">3★</Color>: You can get <Color id="money">$27,500</Color> by arresting them (**bonus**: <Color id="money">$13,275</Color> | **assisting the arrest**: <Color id="money">$9,000</Color>)
- <Color id="4">4★</Color>: You can get <Color id="money">$35,000</Color> by arresting them (**bonus**: <Color id="money">$15,750</Color> | **assisting the arrest**: <Color id="money">$10,500</Color>)
- <Color id="5">5★</Color>: You can get <Color id="money">$50,000</Color> by arresting them (**bonus**: <Color id="money">$22,500</Color> | **assisting the arrest**: <Color id="money">$15,000</Color>)

The **transport bonus** is granted when you **transport the suspect in a vehicle** to a <Color id="police">Police Station</Color>.

If the **suspect's bounty is higher** than the transport bonus (<Color id="money">$22,500</Color>) you will **receive the full bounty instead**.

<Aside type="tip">
    It's better to **use the tazer on a suspect to stun and handcuff them**, instead of killing them *(you'll earn more money)*<br />
    Keep in mind that the suspect can **resist the arrest once every ≈20 seconds!**
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
    <Emoji>⚠</Emoji> Remember that **you can use deadly force only in few cases**, see **[Takedowns](#takedows)** for more information.
</Aside>

### Force entry in warehouse or garage
You are able to forcefully enter **[warehouses](./../properties/warehouses)** or **[garages](./../properties/garages)** if you spot a suspect entering inside them.<br />
If a **wanted suspect knocks at someone's property** and **they let them enter**, you're also **able to enter** following this by pressing <Color id="police">Force entry</Color> in the property's menu.

<Img src="/cops/warehouse_force_entry.webp" alt="Police Officer: Force entry in warehouse" style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px;" />

### Arrest menu
The arrest menu, **accessible via pressing** <Keyboard>X</Keyboard> / holding <ControllerInput type="UP" /> **near a cuffed criminal**, is a menu reserved to <Color id="police">Police Officers</Color> that allows you to:
- <Emoji>🔍</Emoji> **Search**: find if they have **illegal items**, **weapons**, **ammunition** or **drugs** and **seize them** to earn some money.
- <Emoji>🚶</Emoji> **Follow**: make the suspect **follow you behind** *(to your car or police station as examples)*
- <Emoji>🚔</Emoji> **Enter vehicle**: place the suspect **inside your car**, you'll be able to **transport them** to the **nearest Police Station**.<br />
*(you'll earn a transport bonus - see [Arresting a suspect](#arresting-a-suspect))*
- <Emoji>🏢</Emoji> **Hand over the suspect** at **a Police Station desk**.<br />
*(you'll also earn a **transport bonus** - see [Arresting a suspect](#arresting-a-suspect))*
- <Emoji>🚓</Emoji> **Quick Arrest**: call an **NPC transport unit** to handle the suspect but you will not receive the **transport bonus**.<br />
*(so less money than transporting the suspect yourself)*
- <Emoji>💸</Emoji> **Suggest bribe**: suggest a bribe, which will **send a notification to the suspect** and ask them to **pay you for their freedom**.
### Bribes

<Img src="/cops/bribing.webp" alt="Police Officer: Police Station Parking" style="padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px;" />

You can also **suggest them to bribe you** with the **[arrest menu](#arrest-menu)**, or simply by opening your **interaction menu** near them with <Keyboard>E</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="RIGHT" />

A suspect can give you between <Color id="money">$20,000</Color> and <Color id="money">$500,000</Color>, no matter his wanted level.

## Radio
You have access to a radio which allow you to speak with other <Color id="police">Police Officers</Color> and <Color id="paramedic" href="./paramedic">Paramedics</Color>.
<Aside type="tip">
    If you don't want to speak in the voice chat, you can send text messages in radio channels: prefix your message with an exclamation mark <Keyboard>!</Keyboard><br />
    **Example**: <Keyboard>!</Keyboard>**I need backup in Grove Street, 1 active shooter**
</Aside>

You can **access this menu via your job menu** (<Keyboard>M</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="VIEW" /> → Job menu) or by using the <Keyboard>/radio</Keyboard> command.

> You can turn the radio <Color id="non_violent">on</Color>/<Color id="violent">off</Color> and select the **volume of the radio** inside this menu.

    - <Emoji>📡</Emoji> **Emergency (Sandy Shores)** - Default channel in **Sandy Shores**
    - <Emoji>📡</Emoji> **Emergency (Paleto Bay)** - Default channel in **Paleto Bay**

## Tips & Tricks
- **Play with others cops**: it's the **best way to catch every criminal** who are resisting arrest.

- **Play with <Color id="paramedic" href="./paramedic">paramedics</Color>:** They can be with you in your patrol, as long as they are:
  - **Not driving** your patrol vehicle.
  - **Not helping you arrest** a criminal.
  - **Only shooting and helping taking down criminals** that are **hurting you, them or other cops/paramedics** *(Defense of Life)* or **preventing them from reviving a dead player.**

- **Use the radio**: listen to the radio to know **where other officers need help**, and **ask for backup when you need it**.

- **Be prepared with your tazer out**: when another officer is arresting a suspect, they can resist arrest: **keeping the tazer out prevents from running if they manage to resist**.

- **Turn your emergency lights on when you park**: your vehicle can't be impounded by <Color id="mechanic" href="./../civilian/mechanic">mechanics</Color> **if your emergency lights are on**. Press <Keyboard>E</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="L" /> to turn them on.

- **Turn off your siren sound**: You can use the <Keyboard>/siren</Keyboard> command to **turn off your siren sound** or press <Keyboard>U</Keyboard> / double-tap <ControllerInput type="UP" /> when you are in your vehicle.

- **Always restock before going on patrol**, and after dying if you can.
