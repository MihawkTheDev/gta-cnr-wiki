## Paramedics rules
<Img src="/paramedic/rules.webp" alt="Rules illustration"/>

Rules about paramedics **changed on October 2024**, paramedics are now:
    - allowed to **attack first criminals** who would **be a threat to them** in case **they went for a revive/heal**.
    - allowed to act in **self-defense**, **defense** of other <Color id="paramedic">paramedics</Color>, <Color id="police">cops</Color> and **innocent civilians**.
    - allowed to **chase suspects with** <Color id="police">cops</Color> (paramedics can only shoot if the threat is still active).
Additionnaly, **criminals are now allowed to attack paramedics** who are **getting too close** (assault rifle range) and **there are opponents or enemies to revive** in the area.

You can find the [**full rules on the CNRV website**](https://gtacnr.net/rules/full).

## Tips & Tricks
- **Play with <Color id="police" href="./cops">Police Officers</Color>:** you can ride with them in their patrol, so long as you are:
  - **Not driving** their patrol vehicle.
  - **Not helping them arrest** a criminal.
  - **Following** the [**paramedic rules**](#paramedics-rules).

- **Park your ambulance in a way that it can be used as cover in case of an attack**: after they aim or shoot at you, leave the ambulance and **fire back**.

- **Buy some weapons to defend yourself**: Although most of the time you will be protected thanks to police officers, sometimes you will be left alone or vulnerable in some emergency situations: even if your selection of weapons is weak, it's still better to defend yourself than letting yourself be killed!

- **Communication is key so cooperate with cops**: stay around cops **that seem to pursue a dangerous individual**, heal them when you can and when they need it and let them do their job while staying close and being supportive.

- **Try to play with other medics when you can**: sure, you won't make as much money as if you had the monopoly on every revive and heal, but at least you can act quickly and go from one scene to another if you have help with you.
