# Cop Guide - Arrest Menu and Bribery
When you cuff someone, an arrest menu shows up. There are different options, let's go over them.
Searching lets you confiscate all illegal items off of the suspect for a prize.

Following... shockingly... makes the suspect follow you around.

Enter Vehicle makes the suspect enter your last driven vehicle if it is a police car, in range and has back seats.

Quick Arrest calls a transport unit for the suspect.

Suggesting a Bribe allows the suspect to bribe you, you get the option to take the bribe for yourself, share it or report the incident. Keeping the bribe takes away XP, while sharing or reporting gives it to you.
