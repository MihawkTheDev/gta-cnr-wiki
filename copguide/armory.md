# Cop Guide - Armory
Every cop needs to be armed to the teeth in Los Santos, unfortunately the LSPD can't afford to give each cop anything better than a Pistol.
They can, however, afford to put up an armory and let them buy it out of their own pocket. Capitalism, baby!
In the armory, available at select Police Stations, you can find exclusive guns and items that civilians don't have access to, they range from tear gas to heavy sniper rifles, so there is truly something for everybody.
