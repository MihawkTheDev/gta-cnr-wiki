# Cop Guide - Takedown or Arrest
After becoming a cop, you will find wanted players that can be arrested or taken down.

**Arrest**
Arresting is the basic form of enforcing law as a cop. You walk up to a suspect, tase him or get behind him and cuff them using X or the d-pad. Arresting gives more money than killing the suspect, you can only kill wanted players when they are threatening. When you arrest a player, you can call a transport unit or deliver him to jail in your personal vehicle.

**Takedowns**

People actively threatening you, NPCS or other players/having a red name can be shot unless they are on their knees [just having hands up doesn't make them not-shootable]. The kidnapper in the photo has a bounty on his head but he also has his hands up. Unfortunately for him, he isn't surrendering on his knees, so I can still shoot him. It isn't mandatory to kill threatening suspects but it is allowed.
