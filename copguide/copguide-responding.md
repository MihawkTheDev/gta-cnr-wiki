# Cop Guide - Responding to Calls
There are two types of calls:

1. A player has committed a crime

2. A player is calling for help

An alert will popup in the top left corner of the screen alerting you of one of the two possible scenarios. Press 'Y' or d-pad up to accept the duty. Upon accepting, you will automatically log their location into your GPS. Follow the yellow line to find the last known location of the player.

To get XP for responding to a call, follow the GPS until it ends in a circle. Upon entering that circle (destination) you will be awarded XP.
