# Criminal Guide - Exporting and Scrapping
**Exporting cars will give you a wanted level.**
Upon entering some vehicles, you may see a message at the top left hand corner of the screen saying that you can export the vehicle, and it will list the amount. Press Y or d-pad up to enable GPS to navigate to the export dock. If it does not give you this message upon entering the vehicle, it means that this vehicle is not eligible for export.
The most wanted export vehicle spawns everyday at 5AM and if it isn't exported till next day, the value increases.
Upon arriving at the export dock, you will find a red circle. Drive your vehicle onto the red circle and press 'Y' or d-pad up to export.

Some cars can be scrapped for money at scrapyards instead of getting exported.

Upon entering a vehicle, you may see a message at the top left hand corner of the screen saying that you can scrap the vehicle, and it will list the amount. Press Y or d-pad up to enable GPS to navigate to the nearest scrapyard. If it does not give you this message upon entering the vehicle, it means that this vehicle is not eligible for scrapping. 

Upon arriving at a scrapyard, you will find a red circle. Drive your vehicle onto the red circle and press **Y** or d-pad up to scrap.

Every scrapyard has a multiplier, meaning that the value of every scrapable vehicle will be multiplied by that multiplier when sold at that scrapyard.
