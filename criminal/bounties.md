# Bounties
You can kill players with a *bounty* to get some quick cash. They appear as a red blip on your map and have a red gamertag.

## Earning a Bounty
When you commit certain specific [crimes](/wiki/criminal/crimes), your wanted level can jump to 5 (Most Wanted), causing the server to put a bounty on you. As you commit more and more crimes, the value of your bounty will increase.

## Losing a Bounty
To lose a bounty, you just need to lose your [wanted level](/wiki/criminal/wanted-level#losing-wanted-level) 5, as it was previously explained.
