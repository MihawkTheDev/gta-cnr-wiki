# Wanted Level
Just as in all Grand Theft Auto games, when you commit [crimes](/wiki/criminal/crimes) you will gain stars. These stars, displayed at the top-right of your screen, represent your *Wanted Level*.

Players on a *public service* job are unable to receive a wanted level.

## Level Meanings
| Level | Gamertag/Blip Color | Status | Police Action* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | White** | Innocent | None |
| 1 | Yellow | Lesser Offender | Ticket |
| 2 | Light Orange | Felon | Arrest |
| 3 | Medium Orange | Wanted Suspect | Arrest |
| 4 | Dark Orange | Major Suspect | Arrest |
| 5 | Red | Most Wanted Suspect | Kill or Arrest |

<small>* The police is always [allowed](/rules/full#what-is-defense-of-life) to kill a player that presents a **threat**, even an innocent civilian.</small><br/>
<small>** The color while innocent might vary according to the job. For example, innocent mechanics are gray.</small>

## Innocent
You are innocent when you haven't committed any crime since the last time you respawned. You can also return to the innocent status by [losing your wanted level](#losing-wanted-level).

## Lesser Offender
When you are a lesser offender, the police can order you to stop and give you a [ticket](/wiki/criminal/tickets). If you don't stop, you will gain another wanted level and become a felon, which allows the police to arrest you.

## Felon/Suspect
When you are a suspect, the police can [arrest](/wiki/criminal/arrest) you. To do so, they will try to stun you with a stun gun, or use their vehicle to knock you down (yes, "VDM" is allowed).

## Most Wanted
Congratulations, you gained the highest wanted level possible. It's guaranteed that when you have this wanted level, you will be shot on sight wherever you go, as long as there are players.

When you have a 5-star wanted level, not only cops are allowed to kill you on sight, but also other civilians and criminals can do so because the server has also placed a [bounty](/wiki/criminal/bounties) on you.

## Losing Wanted Level
When you stay away from the area where you committed your last crime and also stay away from the police, you will slowly start losing your wanted level.

In case of a 5-star wanted level, you are also required to not get damaged by any other player in order to lose that bounty.

The required distance from the crime area/police and the time to drop a star depend on your current wanted level.

| Level | Distance | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 200m | 5 minutes |
| 2 | 300m | 1 minute |
| 3 | 400m | 1 minute and 20 seconds |
| 4 | 500m | 1 minute and 40 seconds |
| 5 | 800m | 4 minutes |
