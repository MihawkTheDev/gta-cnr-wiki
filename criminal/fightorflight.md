# Criminal Guide - Fight or Flight

So, you have a wanted level and are being chased by the cops. What could you possibly do?

**Fight**
If you are feeling lucky, you can take your chances at killing or immobilizing the pursuing officer. 
If the officer is on foot and running towards you, you can take a weapon appropriate for the range and shoot them. If the cop is hiding behind a car, try to shoot the fuel tank or engine to easily explode it.
If the officer is in a land vehicle, your best bet is shooting at one of the tires and making the officer crash or alternatively shooting them, watching out for any possible ramming.
If the officer is in a helicopter or a plane, a good idea is always shooting at either the rotor or engine respectively, as aearial vehicles are very prone to damage in these locations.
**Remember that shooting an officer that isn't chasing you can often be RDM, please refer to the rules when thinking about starting a fight.**

**Flight**
A fun way to get rid of the police presence, is evade them. If you are a non-violent criminal, don't shoot when escaping the police, as they cannot attack you unprovoked.
Los Santos and Blaine County have many tunnels, bridges and roads on which you can escape from the police and if on a hardcore server, hide. 
If you like violence, go crazy with shooting the pursuing cars' tires, ramming them off the road and destroying helicopters chasing you.
There are many ways to escape, you just need to find your favorite one.

**Surrendering**
As a criminal, when approached or chased by Law Enforcement Officers, you have the choice to hold 'X' to surrender or press 'X' to put your hands up.
This is by far the least favorable option, as your contraband can be easily seized and you don't have a choice to cancel surrendering unless cops leave the area.

**Bribing**
To bribe or not to bribe, that is the question. Usually you want to abstain from bribing random players, especially ones with a low level or from enemy crews.
If however, you trust the officer you are bribing, you can walk up to them and offer them money for your freedom, you can only bribe with cash, so make sure you always have some withdrawn.
Be wary if a cop is on foot though, as they can easily cuff you when you stand near them to bribe, if they are in a car, tell the cop to stay in to avoid that risk.
**Bribing the police is not available if you are Most Wanted (5 red stars and bounty)**
