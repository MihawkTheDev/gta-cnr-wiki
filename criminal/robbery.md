# Robberies

You will find businesses scattered around San Andreas that can be robbed to obtain cash. To rob these stores, get inside of them, aim a gun at the NPC and shoot around him to fill up the intimidation bar which increases your payout. 
If you rob the store with someone else, they can crack open the safe to secure a bigger payout. Continue aiming at the NPC until he either cannot give more and the robbery succeeds or you have to leave. 
You will see a success message at the bottom of the screen showing how much you were able to rob. If you left before the success message, the robbery will fail. 

Please note that you cannot rob the same place more than once in a row. Go rob another store before returning to rob the same store again. Also, if other players have recently robbed the store, you will need to wait until the store can be robbed again.
**You are allowed to kill someone who joins your robbery without your permission, as they are taking a share of your money.**
